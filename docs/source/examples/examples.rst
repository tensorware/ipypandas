Examples
=====================================

.. note::

    Most of the interactive features of ipypandas require a running Python kernel and are therefore not fully usable within the documentation.
    You may want to `download <https://github.com/tensorware/ipypandas/tree/main/examples>`_ the examples folder and run it locally.

This section contains several examples generated from Jupyter notebooks.
